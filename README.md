# Black Hole Shader
This is a fully ray-marched black hole shader specifically built for the Unity engine (although the shader code is mostly reusable for any general purpose engine).
Performance may vary on each system, my current setup is:

**RAM**: 16GB  
**GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 2070S  
**CPU**: i5-9400F (6-cores, 2.90GHz)

This can run one black hole shader at a time without any issues at any resolution at 200-250FPS.
Again, mileage may vary depending on your system, but if your performance is much lower than you would expect feel free to open an issue about it or make a pull request.
